Motivation
----------

This folder contains *.idea* project folder backups with a valid configuration.

Many programmers do not like to commit *.idea* files in a versioning repository because that forces everybody involved to use the same project configuration and custom settings.
Providing them here instead of the default project locations is a middle point that allows others to either use the configuration they want or choosing a configuration that just works.

Usage
-----
If you want to use these configuration files instead of configuring the plug-in project from scratch yourself, follow these two steps.

- Unzip the *logtak_root.zip* file. Move the folder *.idea* in the root of the Logtalk project.
- Unzip the *coding_idea,zip* file. Move the folder *.idea* in the folder *coding/idea* relative ti the root Logtalk project.

That was it. Now open from IntelliJ the project located at the root Logtalk folder.
